Eye Disease Detection & Lens Recommendation App using DWDM Techniques

Our app is designed to help detect common eye diseases and recommend the best lenses using advanced artificial intelligence. Powered by Deep Learning and DWDM (Data Warehousing and Data Mining) techniques, the app accurately classifies four major eye conditions — Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Normal — just by analyzing retinal images.

The core of this app uses a smart combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce unnecessary data and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle imbalanced datasets. This results in higher accuracy and faster predictions, even with limited data. After applying DWDM techniques, the model’s performance improved significantly, achieving an accuracy of up to 92% with advanced architectures like ResNet.

But the innovation doesn’t stop there. After identifying the eye condition and its severity, the app goes a step further by suggesting the best graphene-based lens suitable for the user’s diagnosis. These lenses are recommended using a simple but effective rule-based system that maps disease and severity to a specific lens type (e.g., Graphene Lens A, B, or C). For example, a user with early-stage Cataract might be recommended Graphene Lens A for better vision support.

Whether you're a doctor, healthcare worker, or someone just looking to keep an eye on your eye health, this app offers a quick, easy, and reliable solution to both diagnose and take action.

No complex setup. Just upload a photo of your retina, let the app scan and predict, and get your personalized lens suggestion — all in under a minute.

It’s AI-powered vision care, simplified.
